Repository is a collection of python scripts used for maintaining Plex movies and posters.

PullPoster

Will go out and pull down posters from ThePosterDB, save them within Kometa directories, and print results that can easily be copied/pasted within a Kometa configuration file. Currently will go out and pull down a collection, set, tv show, movie, or single season.
