Just a very basic python script to parse multiple .nessus files.

Output will be concatenated into a single CSV file, with Hostname, OS, IP, Port, Protocol, Service, Vulnerability, and Description.

To run, place in same directory as .nessus file(s) and execute. Will not work with large nessus files.
