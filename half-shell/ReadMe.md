# Half-Shell

Half-Shell is a simple python script to give the user a native looking prompt for communicating with uploaded $_GET php scripts.

### Prerequisites

Uses python's requests module. If you're not familiar with requests, it's more lightweight and usable compared to urllib or urllib2. More about requests can be found here: https://2.python-requests.org//en/master/

```
pip install requests
```
